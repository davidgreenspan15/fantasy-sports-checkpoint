With Kamara leaving early last Sunday against the Buccaneers, Williams wound up getting a season-high 19 carries for 58 yards. Not normally much of a pass catcher, Williams also had four receptions for 13 yards last week. If Kamara misses Week 18, Williams should handle a massive workload against the Falcons in the regular-season finale. I think Williams should be the top waiver add of the week for anyone who still has skin in the game."

He had only six touches against the Bears last week, but one of them was a 75-yard TD catch. Allgeier probably isn’t going to be a Week 18 savior for any fantasy manager counting on him, but his relatively sturdy floor gives him some appeal."

He finished with only four receptions for 31 yards, and it’s not optimal that the targets are coming from QB Easton Stick. But the Chargers have little incentive to rush Allen or Palmer back for a meaningless regular-season finale, so Everett seems likely to get another heavy dose of targets Sunday vs. the Chiefs."

He gets a favorable matchup this week against an Atlanta defense that has allowed the 10th-most fantasy points to TEs."
"145",9,"Jameson Williams",DET,"WR60","9","With chronically low target volume, Williams doesn’t offer a safe weekly floor. But the speedy second-year receiver has gotten a slight usage uptick over the last month, with snap shares in the 57%-68% range in each of his last five games. Williams has some serious splash-play potential, and he’ll be facing a Vikings pass defense that looked completely out of sorts in a New Year’s Eve loss to the Packers."

D’Onta Foreman was a healthy inactive for the Bears last week, so it appears this has gone from a three-man backfield to a two-man show. Roschon gets a favorable Week 18 matchup against a Green Bay defense that ranks 26th in DVOA vs. the run and has allowed the 12th-most fantasy points to running backs."

Over his last four games, Wan’Dale has 19-175-0 on 27 targets. He hasn’t recorded a TD catch since Week 9, but Wan’Dale had a 24-yard TD run against the Rams last week.
